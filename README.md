Machine Learned Annotation of tweets about politicians’ reputation during Presidential Elections The cases of Mexico and France
 ==============================

## Presentation
These scripts are meant to classify Micro-Blogs dealing with the online reputation of politians. We use experts assements about the online reputation of various industrial (from RepLab 2013 dataset http://nlp.uned.es/replab2013) and political (from TASS 2013 www.daedalus.es/TASS2013/corpus.php and Imagiweb http://mediamining.univ-lyon2.fr/velcin/imagiweb/dataset.html) entities to learn (with some Machine Learning techniques such as SVM) the reputation polarity associated to the words used in the tweets content.

We also proposed to tackle the issue using Lexicon-based approaches by adapting existing polarity lexicon to our case.

Please, cite [CAM'15] if you use our scripts and data. We would also be very interested to know your context of application and/or modification, so please, let us know.
 
Note the software may evolve depending on our future research work.
